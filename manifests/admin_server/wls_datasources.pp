  # This is a simple way to get started. It is easy to get started, but
  # soon your hiera yaml become a nightmare. Our advise is when you need
  # to let puppet manage your tablespaces, to override this class and 
  # add your own puppet implementation. This is much better maintainable
  # and adds more consistency,
